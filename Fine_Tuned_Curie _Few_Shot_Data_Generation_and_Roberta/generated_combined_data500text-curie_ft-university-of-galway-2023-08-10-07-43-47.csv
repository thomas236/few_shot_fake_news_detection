That didn’t last long. 
They had to go after the highest elected official in the land, so they blasted President Trump and accused him of colluding with the Russians.

“But I think the whole world wants North Korea to stop. And if they do that, we’ll see a different North Korea,” she added. 
Last week, Haley announced that the U.S. would be sending “a strong message” to North Korea with its latest missile launch. This prompted the U.N. to call an emergency meeting.

However, one issue that was largely absent during the election was the topic of nuclear weapons. 
This is surprising, to say the least, as Trump has made clear that he intends to use nuclear weapons first and without thinking twice.

However, when asked if he would use nuclear weapons in the same situation, Trump responded by saying, “I don’t want to use nuclear weapons. I think nuclear weapons are very powerful, but I don",1

[As more people turn to the Internet to get their news and information, the media is feeling threatened by these alternative sources, causing many to question the validity of everything they see online.  Two websites that have suffered from the lack of trust by the mainstream media are Wikileaks and Alex Jones’s website, Infowars, which is known for publishing leaked information. In a column published over the weekend, The Washington Post’s media critic, Margaret Sullivan, openly admitted that she no longer trusts what she reads online because of the rise of the alternative media. “Trust in the media is at historic lows.

That’s why Trump is going all-out to make sure that his delegates are locked down and won’t be able to shift their votes to a different candidate, as has happened multiple times in the past. 
For example, in 2012, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich was supposed to be the man to get the delegates to dump Mitt Romney and try to get the nomination for someone like Ron Paul. But Gingrich was so focused on getting his delegates to stick with Romney that he failed to get them to sign a loyalty pledge to him, so the RNC could not make Gingrich’s delegates sign the pledge.
