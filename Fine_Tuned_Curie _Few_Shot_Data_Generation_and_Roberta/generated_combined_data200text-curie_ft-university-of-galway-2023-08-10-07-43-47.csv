I will. ” Mr. Trump is expected to fire Mr. Sessions as soon as next week. In an interview on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump defended his decision to fire Mr. Sessions and to seek his resignation, saying that the attorney general had given him bad advice. “He probably took the advice of some executive that I read about where he used to work,” Mr. Trump said. “I thought it was a very unfair thing like you can’t do that",AI,">Donald J. Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, appeared on “The Sunday Show,” and was asked about a leaked tape from 2005 in which Mr. Trump, who was then the owner of the Miss Universe Organization, was heard making lewd comments about women. “We’re going to have so much fun,” Mr. Trump said of the 2005 tape, according to a CNN report.
